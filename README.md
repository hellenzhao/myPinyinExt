# myPinyinExt

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to create a chrome extension that provides pinyin and English translations upon mousing-over a Chinese word.


## Acknowledgements
My extension is inspired by similar ones, such as:
* https://github.com/Paperfeed/LiuChan/tree/master
* https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen/tree/master

I also include a list of links in `resources.txt`. This contains reference material on coding and Chinese language conventions that I found helpful.
